Welcome to the official documentation for **LocalSpace**.

LocalSpace is a comprehensive, type-safe, full-stack boilerplate designed to accelerate web application development. It provides a solid foundation with a modern technology stack, pre-configured libraries, and a set of reusable packages for common functionalities.

### Core Philosophy

- **End-to-End Type Safety**: Leveraging TypeScript across the entire stack, with tools like `tuyau` to create a type-safe API layer between the backend and frontend.
- **Developer Experience**: A focus on clean code, clear architectural patterns, and a streamlined development environment within a pre-configured monorepo.
- **Modularity**: Common logic is extracted into reusable packages (`@localspace/lib`, `@localspace/ui`, `@localspace/node-lib`) to promote code sharing and maintainability.
