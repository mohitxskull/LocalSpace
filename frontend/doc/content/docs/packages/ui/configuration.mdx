## `setting.ts`

The file `packages/ui/src/configs/setting.ts` contains static, read-only configuration for the UI package.

### Default Configuration

The configuration object is exported `as const`. This is a TypeScript feature that makes its properties deeply `readonly` and allows the compiler to infer the most specific literal types for its values, rather than general types like `string`.

```typescript
export const setting = {
  app: {
    name: "Localspace",
    description: "Localspace is a boilerplate for building web applications",
    themeColor: "#ffffff",
  },
} as const;
```

### Usage

This configuration is used by components within the package. For example, the `Logo` component uses `setting.app.name` to render the application's name.

You can import and use these settings in your application as needed, or modify the file directly to suit your project's branding. Because of the `as const` assertion, TypeScript will prevent any accidental modifications to this object at runtime, ensuring the configuration remains consistent.
