description: How to set up and run the LocalSpace project on your local machine.
---

This guide will walk you through the steps required to get the LocalSpace monorepo up and running for development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Version 20.6.0 or higher.
- **pnpm**: This project uses `pnpm` as its package manager. You can install it with `npm install -g pnpm`.

## 1. Installation

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies using `pnpm`.

```bash
pnpm install
```

This command will install dependencies for all the packages (`frontend`, `backend`, `ui`, etc.) in the monorepo.

## 2. Environment Variables

The backend server requires a set of environment variables to run. The project includes an example file that you can use as a template.

1.  Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend/core`
2.  Copy the example file: `cp .env.example .env`

Now, open the newly created `.env` file and review the variables. For local development, the default values for the database, Redis, etc., are generally sufficient, but you may need to provide your own `CAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY` and other secrets.

For a detailed explanation of all variables, see the [Environment Variables documentation](/docs/environment-variables).

## 3. Running the Development Server

This project uses **Turborepo** to manage the monorepo tasks. You can start the development servers for both the frontend and backend with a single command from the root of the project.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command will:

- Start the **AdonisJS backend** API server in watch mode.
- Start the **Next.js frontend** development server.

Once the command finishes, you should be able to access:

- The frontend application at `http://localhost:3000`.
- The backend API at `http://localhost:3333`.
